11905,"IIRC this was done on purpose: an epoch is a fixed point in time, whereas a naive datetime can have multiple interpretations. I'm not sure using settings.TIME_ZONE as default fallback is always correct. The absence of fallback is a way to raise issues when naive datetime are passed around. The fix is to make these datetimes aware (as you did  ), but I'd keep epoch() fail rather than being at risk of being off by X hours.",Consider handling the case when the input datetime object 'dt' is naive (does not have a timezone). It is recommended to either make sure all input datetimes are timezone-aware before calling this function or handle the case of naive datetimes appropriately to avoid potential issues.
8566,,Consider renaming the function glob_entries to something more descriptive to indicate its purpose or intent. This will improve the readability and maintainability of the code.

Instead of passing multiple variables to functions makeflow_generate_input_files, makeflow_generate_output_files, makeflow_file_list_format, and makeflow_wrap_umbrella, consider refactoring these functions to accept a single structured object or class that encapsulates all necessary parameters related to input files, output files, monitors, wrappers, and umbrellas."
14680,"This really isn't needed here, let's remove it.",The 'response' method in the 'TestHeader' class directly accesses 'ctx.options.testheader' without checking if 'testheader' exists in 'ctx.options'. It is recommended to add a conditional check to ensure 'testheader' exists before trying to access it to prevent potential errors.
11212,Shouldn't we do the same we do in `add_flow` here? (Maybe we can even factor that out in its own `update_focus` method),The 'elif self.follow_focus' condition should be explicitly checked for 'True' or 'False' values to ensure clarity and avoid potential bugs. Consider updating the condition to 'elif self.follow_focus is True' or 'elif self.follow_focus is False'.

4565,"Thanks for this! I'd prefer to keep the test that checks for the theme value as a separate one, like the other style functions. Would you mind updating this to include tests for both: - `lineHeight returns a scalar style` - `lineHeight returns responsive line-height`","Consider adding more descriptive test cases to cover different scenarios of responsive line-height values, such as negative values or edge cases. This will ensure comprehensive test coverage for the lineHeight function."
4788,"I don't think you want to use `defaultScale` here because this would always use the default scale even when a different scale is set in the theme, right? Btw, thanks for the PR to fix this!",It seems like the 'defaultScale' variable is being used but not declared or defined in the context of this code snippet. Make sure 'defaultScale' is properly defined and available within the scope of these functions to avoid any reference errors.
